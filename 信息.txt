3) Your unique and innovative way of building the network

Our metabolic network takes glucose metabolism as the main line, connecting various metabolic pathways through key intermediates. 

In order to make the overall metabolic network clear and beautiful, we divide all metabolic pathways into four categories: carbohydrate, lipid, protein and nucleic acid, and express them with their characteristic substances. 

For some important intermediates, we use one-way or two-way arrows to indicate the direction of the substance and its connection with other metabolic pathways. 

Our work has well integrated a series of biochemical reactions involved in this course, and clarified the internal close relationship between various biological macromolecules through carding.
